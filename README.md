# Personal Running Performance Analysis


## Overview
This project tracks and analyzes my personal running journey as a recreational runner, from beginner level to a sub-2-hour half-marathoner.

This project is designed as a longitudinal performance log that contains training volume, intensity, effort, physiological signals, gear and weather context overtime. 

The primary goal is demonstrates end-to-end data engineering, data modeling and analytics thinking through the lens of distance running performance analysis, using real-world, evolving dataset.

Note: Personal data is exlcuded for privacy reasons.


## Tech Stack
- Database: SQLite with normalized schema design
- Data Sources:
  - Garmin Connect API
  - Strava API
  - Weather API (Open-Meteo)
  - Manuaal Logging (subjective metrics)
- Analysis: Python


## Core Questions
- How does consistent training translate into measurable performance improvement?
- How do effort, perceived feel, and physiology evolve over months of training?
- How do external factors (terrain, surface, shoes, weather) interact with performance?
- What weekly mileage correlates with good performance and endurance?
